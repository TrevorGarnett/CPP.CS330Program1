# CPP.CS330Program1
This project implements algorithms to model movements such as "Seek", "Arrive" and "Flee", coded in C++. It takes in starting positions and attributes, and outputs in a .txt file the character's position, velocity, and acceleration. This can then be plotted using a program provided by the instructor.
